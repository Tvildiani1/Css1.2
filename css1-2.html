                <h2 id="Themagic"> THE MAGIC OF GLOWING CREATURES</h2>
                <p id="Didyouknow"> 
                     Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It's like nature's version of neon lights!
                </p>  
                <p id="Hereshow"> Here's how it works: </p>
                <ol id="list1"> 
                    <li> A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen. </li>
                    <li> An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process. </li>
                    <li> Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat - it's called “cold light.” </li>
                </ol>
